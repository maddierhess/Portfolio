* President's Scholarship Recipient at the University of Portland

## Projects

* [Spatial Analysis of Alcohol Use, Tobacco Use, and Obesity Rates Around the World](https://github.com/Comp-Soc-Science-Methods/HW1/tree/main):
  
  This project uses Python and R to explore global public health data using spatial analysis techniques. Using data from the CIA World Factbook, the analysis identifies countries with the lowest rates of alcohol        consumption, tobacco use, and adult obesity. Python was used to bin and categorize the health variables, and R (via sf and ggplot2) was used to visualize the spatial distribution of these indicators. The project      culminated in a choropleth map highlighting the "healthiest" countries based on the combined metrics.
  
* [Detecting Communities in Social Networks](https://github.com/Comp-Soc-Science-Methods/HW2):

  This multi-case project explores community detection techniques using real-world network data. Across three cases—corporate relationships in Peru, social connections in Seattle, and international soccer player        affiliations—different graph-based algorithms were used to uncover patterns of community structure.
  
* [School Selection Using AHP](https://github.com/Comp-Soc-Science-Methods/HW3_ahp):

  Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to rank three schools based on six criteria: learning, friends, school life, vocational training, college prep, and music classes. Pairwise comparison matrices were created           for both criteria and alternatives using data from Google Sheets. The Python library ahpy was used to calculate weights and consistency ratios.

* [Undergraduate Thesis: Generational Differences in News Consumption Habits](https://github.com/maddierhess/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Senior%20Thesis.pdf):
  
  This study investigated generational differences in common routes to news, attitudes towards news, and levels of knowledge surrounding current events. 138 adults belonging to Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, and Baby        Boomer age categories completed a survey which assessed importance of specific modes of media related to news consumption, importance of specific social media platforms in relation to news consumption, and            attitudes surrounding news-seeking. A twenty-question current events trivia also examined participants’ level of knowledge about current events. It was found that routes to news, especially social media platforms,    varied significantly across age groups. Next, dependence on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for news increased the younger the age group. Finally, Gen Z proved to be the most news avoidant age group and the least      knowledgeable about current events.

* [Add Health Research Paper: Chronic Juvenile Delinquency](https://github.com/maddierhess/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/SOC%20438%20FINAL%20PAPER-3.pdf):
  
  This project relies on data collected from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, also known as Add Health, in order to examine what causes juveniles to become chronic offenders. I propose three        theories that aim to contribute to this analysis: Control theory, strain theory, and exposure to deviant peers.
